dali_1,biscuit_meringe.png,Biscuit Meringue,"Meringue Biscuits

For the biscuit dough
125 g sugar
100 g flour
60 g butter
4 eggs
300 g nuts
100 g sugar
200 g butter
2 eggs
1 cup Bordeaux wine
300 g candied fruits

For the meringue
4 egg whites
250 g powdered sugar
1 tsp. cinnamon

In a medium mixing bowl, combine the sugar and the yolks of 4 eggs.
With a spatula or a wooden spoon, work the mixture. You are done when it becomes mousse-like and nearly white.

Beat 4 egg whites to firm peaks. Melt the butter over low heat, then let it cool to room temperature.
Immediately mix the egg whites with the flour.
Once they are incorporated, fold in the melted butter.
This mixture must be made without stopping but also with much delicateness.
When it is well combined, stop mixing; do not over-mix, or else the biscuits will take on a texture that is disagreeable in both sight and taste. (ed: here, immediately before baking, you might combine with the egg yolk mixture? come back to this later.)
Put this mixture into a baking dish (ed: probably a muffin tin) that has been buttered and floured. Bake in an oven preheated to “thermostat 6” (ed: approx 400F?) for 20 minutes.

While the biscuits are baking, crush the nuts and mix with (ed: the 100 g?) sugar and (ed: the 200 g?) butter. Work into a cream. Cut the candied fruits into small pieces.

Remove the biscuits from the oven and slice each twice horizontally. Score each layer and sprinkle with the Bordeaux.
On the base, spread the biscuit layer with the nuts in butter, scatter the candied fruit pieces on top, then place the next layer of biscuit, spread that with the nuts in butter and candied fruit pieces, and top with the final biscuit layer.

In a medium mixing bowl, whip the egg whites to stiff peaks.
Then, with a spatula, carefully fold in the powdered sugar and cinnamon.
Butter and flour a baking sheet.
Place the biscuit in the oven.
With a metal spatula, a large knife, or simply a spoon, cover the biscuit in the stiffly-beaten egg whites.
If you have a pocket, you can decorate. (ed: ??? could be slang like “if you got pussy you can decorate”)
Put into the oven at “thermostat 2” (ed: approx 300F) for 45 minutes. The oven door must remain partially open during this step.",,France,Les dîners de Gala,image/png,en,,,

[ingredients are partially cut off]
100 g butter
125 g chocolate
3 eggs

Put the rum, sugar, and prunes into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and let simmer for twelve minutes.
In the fridge with the juice, the prunes will plump up.
Strain the prunes, put them into a medium mixing bowl, crush with a fork, then mix in the butter.
Melt the chocolate into the rum mixture, wherein you have mashed the prunes.
Then, add the egg yolks one after another.
Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold in the mixture with a spatula.
Put this into a buttered and floured baking dish.
Warning! This dough will rise in the oven, so only fill the dish 2/3 of the way.
Place into the oven at “thermostat 5” (ed: approx 375F) for 1 hour.
After removing from the oven, unmold and decorate with prunes.",,France,Les dîners de Gala,image/png,en,,,

1/2 L grape juice
1/2 L apricot juice (ed: apparently “apricot” can be slang meaning ~pussy. Take this as you will.)
8 Tbsp semolina (ed: preferably wheat, not corn)
100 g powdered sugar
100 g crème fraîche
200 g brandy-soaked plums
200 g crème fraîche
40 g powdered sugar

Put the grape juice and apricot juice into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then rain (ed: sift?) in the semolina. Stir with a wooden spoon, letting boil for 5 minutes.
Add the crème fraîche and remove from the heat.
When the mixture has cooled, whip it until it lightens.
When it lightens, add the plums, which have been chopped into bits (ed: have they been?).
But this dessert is also well loved by children and, in this case, you can simply leave out the alcoholic fruits.
Put into a deep dish, then place this into the refrigerator.
Beat the powdered sugar with the crème fraîche to make whipped cream, like with the peach and almond recipe from page 290.
If you made the whipped cream in advance, put it into a sieve, so that the whey strains out.
At time of serving, top the fruit cream with the whipped cream.",,France,Les dîners de Gala,image/png,en,,,
dali_4,peches_aux_amandes.png,Peches aux Amandes,"Peaches with Almonds

200 g almonds
200 g walnuts
200 g powdered sugar
3 tbsp water
6 tbsp cognac
1 large jar of crème fraîche
6 yellow peaches
12 tsp redcurrant jello

Soak the almonds and walnuts in fresh water for two hours.
Crush with a firm hand; it is necessary to reduce them to a truly smooth paste.
Then, add to that the sugar mixed with the cognac.
Mix well.
Whisk the crème fraîche, to make a whipped cream, (in order to not risk making butter, let it rest for two hours before this in the refrigerator and stop whisking once it clings to the whisk).
With a spatula, combine the cream with the nut mixture.
Pour onto a greased sheet pan.
Leave it in the freezer for 1 hour, then in the fridge for another hour.
Meanwhile, split the peaches and, by rotating the two halves in opposite directions, remove the pits.
Dust the pieces with powdered sugar and fill the holes with the redcurrant jello.
Light the broiler and put the peaches in the oven, in the bottom of a dish, with the dish in the bottom of the oven.
Let that go 15 minutes.

A paring knife is well suited to this operation.
Put the zests into a little water and bring it to a boil for 5 minutes.
Remove the zests and cut them into thin strips.
Juice the skinned lemons along with 3 others. There will remain 3 that you cut into rounds. [ed: the word used here can apparently be a euphemism for asshole, but is also used for fruit slices.]
Into the lemon juice, add 200 g sugar; the rest of the sugar will be used later.
Put into that the zest strips and the lemon slices, cooking them on low heat for 20 minutes.
Flatten the cookies and pour the rum onto them.
Remove the lemon slices and replace them with the rum-soaked cookies.
Let boil another 5 minutes.
With a rolling pin, roll out the dough to around 1 cm thickness, and put that in the oven in a tart dish.

-Take some fine flour in a bowl and add a little salt. Beat one egg and two egg yolks into it.
-Pour some milk into this mixture while stirring, until thick like an ice cream donut.
-Melt a bit of lard, and take some dough. Cut the dough into four squares, and brush the sides with egg white.
-In the middle, you should leave a small airspace as you connect the squares together. Fill this space with whatever you like, taking care to not break the dough.
-Fry the donut in the lard.
