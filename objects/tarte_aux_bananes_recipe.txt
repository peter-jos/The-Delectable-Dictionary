[ingredients are partially cut off]
250 g flour
100 g butter
Â½ cup water
2 eggs
2 spoonfuls sugar
8 lemons
250 g sugar
4 spoonfuls rum
4 sweet cookies [sugar cookies?]
3 bananas

In advance, remove the butter from the fridge and cream it.
Mix it with a pinch of salt and place it in the middle of the flour.
With the water, dissolve the sugar, and begin to pour it into the butter and flour, then add the eggs.
Work the dough, kneading with your palm. It will become firm and no longer stick to your fingers. Let it rest for 2 hours.
Remove the zest of 2 lemons, that is to say, the colored part of the skin, without touching the white second skin [the pith].
A paring knife is well suited to this operation.
Put the zests into a little water and bring it to a boil for 5 minutes.
Remove the zests and cut them into thin strips.
Juice the skinned lemons along with 3 others. There will remain 3 that you cut into rounds. [ed: the word used here can apparently be a euphemism for asshole, but is also used for fruit slices.]
Into the lemon juice, add 200 g sugar; the rest of the sugar will be used later.
Put into that the zest strips and the lemon slices, cooking them on low heat for 20 minutes.
Flatten the cookies and pour the rum onto them.
Remove the lemon slices and replace them with the rum-soaked cookies.
Let boil another 5 minutes.
With a rolling pin, roll out the dough to around 1 cm thickness, and put that in the oven in a tart dish.
Dock the bottom with a sharp knife.
Pour the lemon juice mixture into the bottom.
Peel the bananas and cut them into slices. Lay them out, alternating with the lemon slices, into the prepared tart pan. Sprinkle with the remaining sugar. Bake at [thermostat 7] for 25 minutes.
