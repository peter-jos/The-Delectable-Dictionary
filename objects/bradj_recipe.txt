Ingredients:
1.5 kg fine semolina
1 demi-liter oil
5g salt
1 kg crushed dates, with a little oil
1 teaspoon powdered cloves
1 teaspoon cinnamon

Process:
-Knead the crushed dates with a little oil. Get rid of their waste (cores, cupules, hard skins).
-Form a homogeneous dough and knead with the cloves and cinnamon.
-Mix the semolina and oil, forming a sand-like dough. 
-Add the orange blossom water, with the salt diluted in it.
-Work while adding a little water (about 1 quart to 1 half liter). Divide the resulting composition into two equal parts. Form a ball with one part.
-Flatten it slightly. Arrange above and in the same way the ball of dates then cover with the second portion of dough.
-Roll out these three layers with a roller or by hand into a round sheet 1 centimeter thick.
-Cut into large enough diamonds.
-Preferably cook on a tadjin, that is to say on an iron plate placed on a kanoun.
-When one side is red, flip over and cook the other side.
-Otherwise, you can cook in a medium oven, taking care to turn the pieces over and put them in the oven again.
