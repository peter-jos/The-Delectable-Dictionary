Process
-Take some fine flour in a bowl and add a little salt. Beat one egg and two egg yolks into it.
-Pour some milk into this mixture while stirring, until thick like an ice cream donut.
-Melt a bit of lard, and take some dough. Cut the dough into four squares, and brush the sides with egg white.
-In the middle, you should leave a small airspace as you connect the squares together. Fill this space with whatever you like, taking care to not break the dough.
-Fry the donut in the lard.
