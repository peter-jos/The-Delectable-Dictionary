[ingredients are partially cut off]
100 g butter
125 g chocolate
3 eggs

Put the rum, sugar, and prunes into a saucepan. Bring to a boil and let simmer for twelve minutes.
In the fridge with the juice, the prunes will plump up.
Strain the prunes, put them into a medium mixing bowl, crush with a fork, then mix in the butter.
Melt the chocolate into the rum mixture, wherein you have mashed the prunes.
Then, add the egg yolks one after another.
Beat the egg whites to stiff peaks and fold in the mixture with a spatula.
Put this into a buttered and floured baking dish.
Warning! This dough will rise in the oven, so only fill the dish 2/3 of the way.
Place into the oven at “thermostat 5” (ed: approx 375F) for 1 hour.
After removing from the oven, unmold and decorate with prunes.
