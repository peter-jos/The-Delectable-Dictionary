Ingredients:
200g sugar
200g butter
3 lemons
6 egg yolks

Process:
-Zest and squeeze your lemons into a pot, bringing them to a boil and letting them boil for 5 minutes. Use large lemons, as you will want about 1.5 deciliters(~2/3 cup) of lemon juice.
-Remove from heat, and add the butter. Let the butter melt into the liquid.
-Once melted, return to heat and boil.
-Remove from heat and let cool completely.
-Once cool, add the yolks, one by one, mixing very well so they don't curdle.
-Bring to a simmer again, stirring constantly until this mixture becomes a thick cream.
-Pour into a large bowl or into individual bowls.
-Once cool, sprinkle with sugar and burn with a hot knife.
