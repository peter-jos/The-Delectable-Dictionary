Peaches with Almonds

200 g almonds
200 g walnuts
200 g powdered sugar
3 tbsp water
6 tbsp cognac
1 large jar of crème fraîche
6 yellow peaches
12 tsp redcurrant jello

Soak the almonds and walnuts in fresh water for two hours.
Crush with a firm hand; it is necessary to reduce them to a truly smooth paste.
Then, add to that the sugar mixed with the cognac.
Mix well.
Whisk the crème fraîche, to make a whipped cream, (in order to not risk making butter, let it rest for two hours before this in the refrigerator and stop whisking once it clings to the whisk).
With a spatula, combine the cream with the nut mixture.
Pour onto a greased sheet pan.
Leave it in the freezer for 1 hour, then in the fridge for another hour.
Meanwhile, split the peaches and, by rotating the two halves in opposite directions, remove the pits.
Dust the pieces with powdered sugar and fill the holes with the redcurrant jello.
Light the broiler and put the peaches in the oven, in the bottom of a dish, with the dish in the bottom of the oven.
Let that go 15 minutes.
Remove the nut mixture from its pan.
Put it onto the broiled peaches.
Serve.
