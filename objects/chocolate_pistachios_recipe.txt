Ingredients
Chocolate
1/2 pound sugar
2 egg whites

Process
-Grate 8 Loth chocolate on a grater.
-Take 1/2 pound of sugar, grate it, then beat 2 egg whites into it, and crush it well in a mortar to make a dough of it.
-Roll it out, cut pieces out of it as you wish, and bake them on a paper-lined pie pan, but not too hot; let them cool before removing from the paper.

Notes:
-The Loth is an obsolete German measurement, roughly equivalent to 1/2 ounce; the ingredients have been adjusted to reflect a more modern measurement
