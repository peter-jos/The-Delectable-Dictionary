Ingredients
1 pound peeled almonds
1 pound sugar
1 pound flour
8 eggs
1/4 oz cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, cardamom
A little ginger
Lemon zest


Process:
-Take 1 pound peeled almond and dry it. Cut the almonds into 3 parts, laying them on a piece of paper and roasting them in the oven.
-Take 1 pound sugar and 1 pound of flour and beat 8 eggs into it. Once the almonds have cooled, add them to this batter as well.
-Add 1/2 Loth cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg, mace, and cardamom, as well as a little ginger.
-Add lemon zest.
-Let it bake in the oven until complete; the dough should be spread on wafers, but not too thick; if the dough flows, put a little strong flour underneath.

Notes:
-The Loth is an obsolete German measurement, roughly equivalent to 1/2 ounce; the ingredients have been adjusted to reflect a more modern measurement
