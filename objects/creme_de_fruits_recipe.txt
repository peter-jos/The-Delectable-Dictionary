1/2 L grape juice
1/2 L apricot juice (ed: apparently “apricot” can be slang meaning ~pussy. Take this as you will.)
8 Tbsp semolina (ed: preferably wheat, not corn)
100 g powdered sugar
100 g crème fraîche
200 g brandy-soaked plums
200 g crème fraîche
40 g powdered sugar

Put the grape juice and apricot juice into a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then rain (ed: sift?) in the semolina. Stir with a wooden spoon, letting boil for 5 minutes.
Add the crème fraîche and remove from the heat.
When the mixture has cooled, whip it until it lightens.
When it lightens, add the plums, which have been chopped into bits (ed: have they been?).
But this dessert is also well loved by children and, in this case, you can simply leave out the alcoholic fruits.
Put into a deep dish, then place this into the refrigerator.
Beat the powdered sugar with the crème fraîche to make whipped cream, like with the peach and almond recipe from page 290.
If you made the whipped cream in advance, put it into a sieve, so that the whey strains out.
At time of serving, top the fruit cream with the whipped cream.
