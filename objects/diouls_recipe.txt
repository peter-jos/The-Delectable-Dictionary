Ingredients:
1 kg fine semolina
Eggs
Water

Process:
-Pour the semolina into a wooden dish, add a pinch of salt, wet with a glass of water and knead, gradually adding water until your dough becomes liquid.
-On a kanoun-brazier well stocked with hot coals, you place, the inner bottom directed towards the fire, a small tin or copper tray (snioua).
-Take a special funnel and fill it with your preparation.
-When your tray is hot, coat it lightly with oil using a cloth and pour a thin layer of your dough on its surface.
-You will thus obtain a very thin pancake. Your diouls are ready.
