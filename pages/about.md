## What is the Delectable Dictionary?

The Delectable Dictionary is a digitized collection of a number of desserts from across the globe, scanned from various cookbooks available from Indiana University Bloomington's Herman B. Wells Library. The recipes included were selected out of an interest of displaying a variety of desserts from various countries, and to display recipes that were both easy and difficult to make to appeal to cooks of various skill levels. 

I created the Delectable Dictionary because I enjoy baking and cooking foods from different places and time periods, and having an easily-accessable and expandable collection of these recipes at hand would be useful not only for me but for anyone else who shares such an interest. The collection for now has the 30 items I've selected as part of this project, but can also easily be expanded in the future to include recipes I would just like to keep around.

## Why only foreign language recipes?

The Delectable Dictionary for now has a specific focus on foreign desserts in order to introduce those dishes to more individuals seeking to try new things, and to have more interesting recipes than what would otherwise be present. In the future, the collection will likely be expanded to include recipes sourced in English.

## Why did you pick these recipes in particular?

The recipes and sources chosen were based on what books were both available and easily scannable. There were other sources available, but in the interest of time and obtaining high quality scans, they were not used.

## How did you process and translate each recipe?

Recipe pages were first sourced from cookbooks directly(all of which were available at the Herman B. Wells Library, as mentioned) and scanned as .tiff images to ensure the highest quality scan. These images were then converted into .png images for use by collectionbuilder-GH, and modified with a collection of image editing software to crop and rotate the images to an acceptable standard. Recipe translations were either done myself, with the aid of other individuals who spoke the language, or with the aid of Google Translate. 

## What's with the weirdly formatted German recipes?

The German recipes chosen were scanned from Simon Pickl's *Das Kochbuch f√ºr Maria Annastasia Veitin : kommentierte Edition einer Kochbuchhandschrift aus dem Jahr 1748*, which included transcriptions of a hand-written cookbook. Some text from the cookbook was evidently illegible or hard to translate, which the transcription reflects. These recipes are much older than the others present in this collection, and thus were written with a different standard of recipe recording; you may notice that these recipes say very little about temperatures, measurements, or times.
