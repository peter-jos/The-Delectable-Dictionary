## What is the Delectable Dictionary?

The Delectable Dictionary is a digitized collection of a number of desserts from across the globe, scanned from various cookbooks available from Indiana University Bloomington's Herman B. Wells Library. The recipes included were selected out of an interest of displaying a variety of desserts from various countries, and to display recipes that were both easy and difficult to make to appeal to cooks of various skill levels.

## Why only foreign recipes?

The Delectable Dictionary for now has a specific focus on foreign desserts in order to introduce those dishes to more individuals seeking to try new things. There is certainly no reason we would not include more familiar recipes in the future.

## Why did you pick these countries in particular?

The recipes chosen are based on what books were both available and functional enough for this project. While there were certainly cookbooks available from countries like Japan or Korea, processing those recipes would have been far more difficult thanks to the character-based nature of their languages. In the interest of time, I have instead chosen to use recipes that were easier to process.
